#IBM-Z-Datathon-2023
The Crisis of Korea's Birth Rate

## Inspiration
Recognizing the gravity of South Korea's low birth rate, we collected reliable data from sources such as news reports and official statistics databases. Our goal was to analyze databases pinpoint the causes and suggest solutions.
 
## What it does
Our project utilizes data gathered from verified sources, including the national statistics of Korea, for example utilizing Jupyter to visually and numerically represent the information in graphs, shedding light on South Korea's low birth rate issue. This approach enhances our understanding of the problem, making it more transparent and comprehensible.
 
## How we built it
We extracted and collected data in Excel and visualized it using Jupyter and PowerPoint. Additionally, we interpreted the information through statistical analysis, derived results, and devised appropriate solutions.
 
## Challenges we ran into
Throughout the project duration, we made concerted efforts to secure trustworthy data and effectively visualize it for presentations. 
In order to stay on topic and stay consistent, we had to remind ourselves of the goals of our project from time to time.
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We gathered accurate and reliable data regarding the pressing societal issue of low birth rates in South Korea. Through visualization, we could present the root causes of the problem and propose potential solutions.
 
## What we learned
Through this project, we honed our analytical skills and collaboration abilities in collecting data, utilizing Jupyter for analysis, and visualizing the results.  We also gained a deeper understanding of South Korea's prominent societal issue, the low birth rate problem.

## What's next for South Korea's birth rate crisis
 We are currently putting significant effort into this problem. However, rather than short-term policies for immediate relief, there is a need for more research and effort in expanding childcare facilities, implementing maternity support in businesses, and fostering collaboration among individuals. This will be essential in seeking more fundamental and innovative solutions
